# Python & Neuroscience Learning Journey

Hi, I'm Shiva!  
This repository documents my personal journey into learning Python, data analysis, and neuroscience.  
I’m especially interested in the mathematical modeling of neural systems and brain dynamics.

Here, I will share:
- Python exercises and small projects  
- Notes on neuroscience and differential equations  
- Progress updates on what I’m learning

My goal is to pursue a PhD that connects mathematics and neuroscience.
